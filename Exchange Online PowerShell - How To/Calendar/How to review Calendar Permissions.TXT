How to review Calendar permissions



Exchange treats the calendar as a sub-folder of the mailbox, adding :\Calendar to the end of the standard permissions query will work.

So you have the below PowerShell cmdlet:

Get-MailboxFolderPermission -identity "John Smith:\Calendar"

You could also grant yourself full access to the mailbox, open the users calendar via OWA and just right click and view permissions.
