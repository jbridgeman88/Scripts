2)	Review the exported CSV file to verify folders and review for any odd characters in path that powershell may not like. Any odd characters found will require the lawyer to rename their folder.



3)	Get existing folder permissions for Top of Information Store for lawyer. Will give you list of existing users if any that have permissions set already.

	    Get-MailboxFolderPermission <Lawyer ID>



4)	Set permissions at Top of Information store for the assistant or user to “foldervisible”.

	 ADD-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <Lawyer ID>@mltaikins.com -User zamancio -AccessRights FOLDERVISIBLE


5)	Verify previous permissions set correctly.

	   Get-MailboxFolderPermission <Lawyer ID>



6)	Set the Default account permissions to “PublishingEditor” on the Client Files folder.

	     Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <Lawyer ID>@mltaikins.com:\".Client Files" -User Default -AccessRights PublishingEditor

	Example as Owner
	     Set-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <Lawyer ID>@mltaikins.com:\".Client Files" -User Default -AccessRights Owner



7)	Verify above permissions set properly.

	    GET-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <Lawyer ID>@mltaikins.com:\".Client Files"
 


8)	Change the permission on all folders under the Client Files folder (or whatever name they have used) for the Default account to 'PublishingEditor'.

	     ForEach($f in (Get-MailboxFolderStatistics '<Lawyer ID>' | Where { $_.FolderPath.Contains("/.Client Files") -eq $True } ) ) { $fname = "<Lawyer ID>:" + $f.FolderPath.Replace("/","\");Set-MailboxFolderPermission $fname -User Default -AccessRights PublishingEditor}


***** For OWNER (ONLY APPLY IF LAWYER HAS SIGNED OFF ON FORM ******

	Example Owner 
	    ForEach($f in (Get-MailboxFolderStatistics '<Lawyer ID>' | Where { $_.FolderPath.Contains("/Client Files") -eq $True } ) ) { $fname = "<Lawyer ID>:" + $f.FolderPath.Replace("/","\");Set-MailboxFolderPermission $fname -User Default -AccessRights Owner}


9)	Verify permission from above command were set correctly on folders under the client files directory.  

This is examply only.

	      GET-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <Lawyer ID>@mltaikins.com:\".Client Files\<name of folder>"


** You are now finished. Going forward you would only have to add the assistant at the top information store level (step 4).
